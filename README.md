# BetterRoutingDecision
---

``` 
We aim to provide alternate routing options other than Google Map suggested. Moreover, we would like to highlight that we want to encourage people to travel in a more environmental-friendly way. Rental bicycle and subway for example, can help reducing pollution and improve our health. Besides transportation time, we intend to achieve the goal by showing user how much calories they can burn and how good the weather is. Moreover, we want the route suggested to be safe, thus safety ranking will also be taken into consideration.
